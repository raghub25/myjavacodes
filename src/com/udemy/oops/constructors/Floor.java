//1. Write a class with the name Floor. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width and length of type double.

//The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.

//In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the length parameter 
//is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.

//Write the following methods (instance methods):
//
//* Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).
