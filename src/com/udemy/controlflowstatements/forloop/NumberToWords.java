//Write a method called numberToWords with one int parameter named number.
//
//The method should print out the passed number using words for the digits.
//
//If the number is negative, print "Invalid Value".
//
//To print the number as words, follow these steps:
//
//1. Extract the last digit of the given number using the remainder operator. 
//2. Convert the value of the digit found in Step 1 into a word. 
//There are 10 possible values for that digit, those being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
//Print the corresponding word for each digit, e.g. print "Zero" if the digit is 0, "One" if the digit is 1, and so on.
//3. Remove the last digit from the number.
//4. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until the number is 0.
//
//The logic above is correct, but in its current state, the words will be printed in reverse order. 
//For example, if the number is 234, the logic above will produce the output "Four Three Two" instead of "Two Three Four". 
//To overcome this problem, write a second method called reverse.
//
//The method reverse should have one int parameter and return the reversed number (int). 
//For example, if the number passed is 234, then the reversed number would be 432. 
//The method  reverse should also reverse negative numbers.
//
//Use the method reverse within the method numberToWords in order to print the words in the correct order.
//
//Another thing to keep in mind is any reversed number with leading zeroes (e.g. the reversed number for 100 is 001). 
//The logic above for the method numberToWords will print "One", but that is incorrect. It should print "One Zero Zero". 
//To solve this problem, write a third method called getDigitCount.
//
//The method getDigitCount should have one int parameter called number and return the count of the digits in that number. 
//If the number is negative, return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
//For example, if the number has a value of 100, the method getDigitCount should return 3 since the number 100 has 3 digits (1, 0, 0).

//HINT: Use a for loop to print zeroes after reversing the number. As seen in a previous example, 100 reversed becomes 1, 
//but the method numberToWords should print "One Zero Zero". To get the number of zeroes, check the difference between the 
//digit count from the original number and the reversed number.
